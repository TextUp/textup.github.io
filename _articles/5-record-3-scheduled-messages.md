## New scheduled message

![Contact plus menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/scheduled-contact-plus-menu.png){: .align-right} You can also schedule messages to send to clients later. Select a contact, click the plus icon next to the text bar, and select “Schedule message.”

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Creating scheduled message with message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/scheduled-creating-message.png){: .align-right} You can have a message  send as a text or a voice call, in which case the text will be read aloud to the recipient via a Siri-esque robo voice.

The voice call scheduled message option is well-suited for clients with a limited text plan,  who have difficulty reading English, or have poor eyesight.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Creating scheduled message with languages]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/scheduled-creating-language.png){: .align-right} If sending a voice call, you can also customize the language the text of the message should be read in.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Creating scheduled message with repeat]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/scheduled-creating-repeat.png){: .align-right} Messages can be scheduled to send on a one-time or recurring basis and you can choose to be notified when the message sends.

{% include step-separator.md %}
