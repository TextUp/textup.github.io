![Toolbar menu - mobile]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/contacts-batch-import.gif){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When adding a new contact, you have the option to import multiple contacts. If you are using the TextUp iOS or Android app, the contacts from your phone will automatically populate for you to select.

Otherwise, you can upload a vCard file of the contacts you'd like to select from. vCard files can be exported from all major contact managers, including those provided by Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo.
