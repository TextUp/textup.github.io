Case notes are snippets of text, images, or locations that can be added anywhere in a contact’s record. These can be added by the user and by all collaborators for a contact.

Whenever a case note is modified in any way, a history of who which user made the change and all prior revisions of the note are preserved.

## Adding a note

![Case notes adding menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-add-menu.jpg){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} For any contact, case notes can be added by pressing the plus button next to the text input field.

Doing so reveals two options under **Documentation**:
* Add note adds a note as the most recent entry in the contact record
* Add past note allows the user to add a note at anywhere in the contact record

![Case notes adding in past]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-add-past.jpg){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} Assume that we selected **Add past note** in the previous menu. This will reveal a column of plus marks. Select one of the plus marks to insert a new note at that point in the contact’s record.

![Case notes inserting media]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-media.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When creating a new note, pressing **Add images** allows the user to attach photos to the new note. On mobile devices, the user can add an existing photo or take a new photo and attach it right away. On devices that support recording audio, you will also be able to record audio memos and attach these to notes.

**Some devices may not currently support recording audio. For those devices, the option to attach audio recordings will not be shown.**

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes adding]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-adding.jpg){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} Assume we have finished attaching an image to the note we are trying to create. We see that our note now has text as well as an image. Notes can have up to 10 images.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes inserting location]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-insert-location.jpg){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} We want to also associate our note with a certain location. Assume we selected the **+ Add Location** option in the previous image. Doing so reveals a map in which we can enter the desired address.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes viewing in record]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-viewing.jpg){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} After a new note is successfully created, the note now can be viewed in the flow of the contact record.

Tapping on the map reveals the address. Tapping on the images reveals a larger version of the image for further examination.

Selecting **the pencil icon** under the text allows the user to edit this note.

## Viewing edit history

![Case notes viewing with history]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-view-with-history.jpg){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} After a note has been edited, all previous versions of the note are saved in the note history. Selecting **the clock icon** reveals the note history.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes edit history]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-history.jpg){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} This is the note history. Listed here are all previous versions of this note, when the change was made and which user made this change.

## Deleting a note

![Case notes viewing note]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-viewing-note.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When you want to delete a note, first go to the note and select **the pencil icon** to open the edit menu.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes opening edit menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-editing.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} After the edit menu is open for this particular note, select **the trash can icon** next to the **Cancel** button.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes confirming delete]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-confirm-delete.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} Confirm the delete to delete the note.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes deleted]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-deleted.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} After the note has been successfully deleted, we see that the note has been replaced by small text indicating that a note previously was shown in this location. If we select the **1 deleted note** text, we can view deleted notes and restore as needed.

TextUp does not allow permanently deleting notes to comply with data storage requirements often observed in social services or healthcare.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Case notes restoring deleted note]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/case-notes-restoring-deleted.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} After selecting the **1 deleted note** text, we can view and restore previously deleted notes.
