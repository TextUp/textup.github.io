## Using the compose menu

![Compose in sidebar]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-compose-sidebar.png){: .align-right} The “Compose” icon is in your left-hand toolbar. Click this to send a text message.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Compose slideout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-compose-slideout.png){: .align-right} This message  can be sent to a contact by name, a phone number, or a tag. If you send the message to a tag, the message will be sent individually to each contact under the tag. This is not a group message.

{% include step-separator.md %}

## To an individual contact

![Composing text for contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-composing-contact.png){: .align-right} If you click on a contact from your inbox, you can also draft a text message from that page via the text bar at the bottom of the screen. Send it by pressing enter or clicking the paper airplane icon.   These texts are sent from your TextUp number.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Text recipients drawer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-recipients-drawer.png){: .align-right} New texts are added to the bottom of the client record. The number next to each text message indicates the number of phone numbers that received this message. If the contact has multiple numbers, TextUp will log attempts all unsuccessful and successful attempts at sending the message to all numbers on file in order of priority.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Text notification]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-notification.png){: .align-right} When a contact replies, you will receive a notification on the TextUp site and a message to your personal phone.  You can turn off the notification texts via the “Your Account” page.

{% include step-separator.md %}

## Through a tag

![Tags list]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-tags-list.png){: .align-right} When viewing the contacts belonging to a tag, the tag's options and record of communication is accessible via the icon to the right of the tag name.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Tag record]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-tag-record.png){: .align-right} After selecting this icon to open up the tag options and record of communication, you will see an interface very similar to the contact's interface. Note that voice calls are not available for tags.

Also, note that the numbers next to each outgoing text in the client record document all contacts who have individually received messages send out through this tag.
