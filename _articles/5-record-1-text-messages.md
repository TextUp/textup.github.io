## Using the compose menu

![Compose in sidebar]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-compose-sidebar.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} The “Compose” icon is in your left-hand toolbar. Click this to send a text message.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Compose slideout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-compose-slideout.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} This message  can be sent to a contact by name, a phone number, or a tag. If you send the message to a tag, the message will be sent individually to each contact under the tag. This is not a group message.

{% include step-separator.md %}

## To an individual contact

![Composing text for contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-composing-contact.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} If you click on a contact from your inbox, you can also draft a text message from that page via the text bar at the bottom of the screen. Send it by pressing enter or clicking the paper airplane icon.   These texts are sent from your TextUp number.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Text recipients drawer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-recipients-drawer.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} New texts are added to the bottom of the client record. The number next to each text message indicates the number of phone numbers that received this message. If the contact has multiple numbers, TextUp will log attempts all unsuccessful and successful attempts at sending the message to all numbers on file in order of priority.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Text notification]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-notification.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When a contact replies, you will receive a notification on the TextUp site and a message to your personal phone.  You can turn off the notification texts via the “Your Account” page.

### Sending images

![Text sending images]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-image.gif){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When you select the option to attach images, the images will appear below your message after they are finished processing. Select any image to see a larger version.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Text selecting versus taking pictures]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-image-attachment-options.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} On mobile devices, you may have the option to take a picture directly or select multiple images from your photo library.

{% include step-separator.md %}

### Sending audio recordings

![Text sending audio recordings]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-audio-message.gif){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When you select the option to attach an audio recording, you will see a audio recorder appear. After you are done recording, you may listen to the recording to decide if you would like to record again. To ensure deliverability, each audio recording has a capped duration. However, you may attach multiple audio recordings.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Text audio recordings not supported]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-audio-not-supported.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} On devices that support do not support recording audio directly, you will see a picture icon to attach images. When you access TextUp using a device that supports audio recording, you will again have the option to attach both images and audio.

{% include step-separator.md %}

## Through a tag

![Tags list]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-tags-list.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When viewing the contacts belonging to a tag, the tag's options and record of communication is accessible via the icon to the right of the tag name.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Tag record]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/text-tag-record.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} After selecting this icon to open up the tag options and record of communication, you will see an interface very similar to the contact's interface. Note that voice calls are not available for tags.

Also, note that the numbers next to each outgoing text in the client record document all contacts who have individually received messages send out through this tag.
