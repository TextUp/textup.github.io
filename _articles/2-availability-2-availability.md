excerpt: "Setting your own availability to determine when you receive notifications"
---

Set your availability to determine when you will receive notifications. The availability you set is **specific to your user account**. Each phone number can have its own away message, but you can only set one schedule that will be used to determine whether or not you will receive notifications across all of the phone numbers you have access to.

## Availability statuses

![Not available status]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/availability-not-available.png){: .align-right} The availability option in the side menu is gray when you are not available.

{% include step-separator.md %}

![Available status]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/availability-yes-available.png){: .align-right} The availability option in the side menu turns green when you are available.

## Configuring availability

### Using a recurring schedule

![Configuring availability using a schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/availability-schedule.png){: .align-right} Add, edit, or update time ranges for each day of week. You will receive notifications within the specified ranges. Contacts will receive the away message via text or via voicemail when you are away.
