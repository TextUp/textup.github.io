Only administrators can add or remove staff from team phones. If you’re an administrator, see this page on [how to add and remove staff from team phones]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/articles/admin-team-membership/). If you’re not an administrator, reach out to your organization’s TextUp administrator for assistance.

If you’re unsure who your organization’s administrator is, contact us at [connect@textup.org](mailto:connect@textup.org).
