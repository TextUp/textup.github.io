![Edit access]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/admineditaccess.png){: .align-right.image.image--with-shadow} Administrators can change the lock code, username, or password for any staff account under their organization. This is useful for removing access to TextUp records when a staff member leaves your organization. To make these changes, select the desired staff member from the staff list.

When you scroll down, you should see options to change their lock code, username, and/or password. You can also force staff members to reset their passwords by selecting their account, clicking the More icon in the top right corner of the screen, and choosing Send Password Reset.
