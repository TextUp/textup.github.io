![Edit availability]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/admineditavailability.png){: .align-right.image.image--with-shadow} Administrators can edit the availability of any staff member under their organization. This is useful if a staff member goes on vacation or is out sick and you want their availability to match accordingly. Select the desired staff member from the staff list.

To the right of the Details menu, you’ll see an option to switch to the Default Availability menu. This will show you what the staff member’s current availability is listed as. You’ll be able to make any required changes. Be sure to click Update to save your changes.
