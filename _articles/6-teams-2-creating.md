Only administrators can create team phones. This is meant to ensure client data is secure as team members will be able to see each other’s team phone client communications. If you’re an administrator, see [this article on creating team phones]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/admin-creating-teams/)

Otherwise, please contact the TextUp administrator for your organization to create a team phone. Email [connect@textup.org](mailto:connect@textup.org) if you’re unsure who your organization’s administrator is.
