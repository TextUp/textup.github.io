## Unlock Google Voice number

Before you can transfer your Google Voice number, you first need to unlock your Google Voice number. Unlocking your number costs $3. You will need to pay this cost, but we will reimburse you or your agency through an agreed-upon method.

* Navigate your web browser to the [Google Voice unlocking page](https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/unlock). For added security, you will need to log in with your Google credentials again.
