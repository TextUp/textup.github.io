excerpt: "Customize away message sent to contacts when you are away."

Away messages are sent to contacts when no user is available to be notified of the message. For incoming text messages, TextUp responds with an away message. For incoming phone calls, TextUp reads the away message using the voice type specified by the user.

## Customizing message for each phone number

Away messages are specific to each phone number. If a user has access to a personal TextUp number and a team TextUp number, these two numbers may have different away messages. Note that this is different for availability, which is set for each user's account and applies to all numbers that the user has access to.

![Personal away message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/away-message-personal.png){: .align-right} This is the away message for Eric's personal TextUp phone number.

![Team away message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/away-message-team.png){: .align-right} Eric is also on the Rapid Rehousing team, which has a team TextUp phone number. Note that this away message is different than the away message Eric specified for his personal TextUp phone.

### Mandatory emergency message

![Editing away message with mandatory emergency message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/away-message-editing.png){: .align-right} Because TextUp is not an emergency messaging service, all away messages include a mandatory emergency disclaimer. This emergency message is not editable and is appended to the end of every away message.

Because of this mandatory emergency message, away messages must be **120 characters or shorter** so that the away message can fit into a single text message (160 character max).

## Changing voice type

![Changing voice type]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/away-message-team.png){: .align-right} For incoming calls, TextUp will read the away message to the caller before asking the caller to leave a voicemail. You can choose either a male or female voice to read this away message.

## Away messages in the record

![Away message text exchange]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/away-message-text-response.png){: .align-right} When a contact texts a TextUp number that doesn't have a user available to receive the notification, TextUp will respond with the custom away message over text.

![Away message annotation in the record]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/away-message-in-record.png){: .align-right} In addition to seeing the contact as unread upon logging in, text messages that received an automated away message response are marked with a clock icon.
