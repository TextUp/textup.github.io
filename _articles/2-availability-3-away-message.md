This article describes how TextUp handles incoming text messages received when no user is available to be notified of the message. For incoming calls, please see the next article.

## Customizing message for each phone number

Away messages are specific to each phone number. If a user has access to a personal TextUp number and a team TextUp number, these two numbers may have different away messages.

![Personal away message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/away-message-personal.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} This is the away message for Eric's personal TextUp phone number.

![Team away message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/away-message-team.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} Eric is also on the Rapid Rehousing team, which has a team TextUp phone number. Note that this away message is different than the away message Eric specified for his personal TextUp phone.

### Mandatory emergency message

![Editing away message with mandatory emergency message]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/away-message-editing.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} Because TextUp is not an emergency messaging service, all away messages include a mandatory emergency disclaimer. This emergency message is not editable and is appended to the end of every away message.

Because of this mandatory emergency message, away messages must be **120 characters or shorter** so that the away message can fit into a single text message (160 character max).

## Away messages in the record

![Away message text exchange]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/away-message-text-response.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} When a contact texts a TextUp number that doesn't have a user available to receive the notification, TextUp will respond with the custom away message over text.

![Away message annotation in the record]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/support/away-message-in-record.png){: .align-right.image.image--article.image.image--article.image--with-shadow} In addition to seeing the contact as unread upon logging in, text messages that received an automated away message are marked as such in the client record.
