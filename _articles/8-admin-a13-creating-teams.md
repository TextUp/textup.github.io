When creating a team, you’ll be asked for the name, identifying color, and address of the team. You have the option to give this team a phone number to share. Giving a team a team phone number means that those team members share access to this TextUp phone number. Team members without a team phone number will still be able to share client communication records with one another. Be sure to press Create to make your team official.
