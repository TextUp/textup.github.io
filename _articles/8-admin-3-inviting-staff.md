Rather than have staff members request TextUp accounts that an administrator will need to approve, administrators can invite people to create TextUp accounts under their organization.

## Mobile

![Sidebar- mobile]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/adminsidebarmobile.png){: .align-right} On a mobile device, you’ll need to access the sidebar by pressing the house icon in the top left corner of your screen. In the sidebar, you’ll want to press the + icon next to “People.”

## Desktop

![Add staff- desktop]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/adminaddstaffdesktop.png){: .align-center}

In desktop view, you can add staff via the Add Staff icon in the left hand toolbar.

![New staff]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/adminnewstaff.png){: .align-right} When inviting a staff member, you’ll need to identify their name, username, and email. The invite will be sent to them via email. You can assign them a TextUp phone number now or later. Be sure to press Create when you’re finished. The invite email will provide a temporary password which the staff member can use to log into TextUp and then reset their password.
