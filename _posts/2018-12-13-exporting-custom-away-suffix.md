## Exporting

Export client communications records to pdf files. Use it for reporting to supervisors, uploading to EHRs, and more. [Read the walkthrough on how to export records.]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/articles/record-exporting/)

**Note: Apple iOS devies (iPhone and iPad) do not support file exporting. However, you can access this feature in desktop view or on other types of smart phones.**

## Customizing mandatory away message

Administrators are now able to customize (or remove) the mandatory portion of the away message. Previously, this message asked clients to call 911 for emergencies. Now, TextUp users are able to customize this message to better suit the needs of their particular organization.

Staff members are still able to add to the mandatory away message with their own custom text. [Read the walkthrough on how to customize the mandatory away message.]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/articles/admin-staff-availability/)
