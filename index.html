                    Technically speaking, TextUp combines a cloud-based phone system with a CRM platform tailored to the needs of social workers and care providers. Our users can access a HIPAA- and FERPA-compliant work phone number from any of their personal devices. While clients communicate with this TextUp work phone number the same way they do with any other phone number, staff have access to the entire TextUp suite of features.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Practically speaking, TextUp gives social work and nonprofit staff the capacity of work phones at a fraction of the price. This gives staff what they want -- work-personal life separation -- while giving clients what they need -- a direct channel of communication. And our automated recordkeeping, one-click mass messaging, and myriad of other time-saving features lighten your administrative burden, giving you more time for direct client service.

                    Our customers serve as advocates and advisors to those who otherwise lack support. But despite the critical importance of their work, many social work agencies are underfunded and short-staffed, creating a high stress work environment. According to the American Public Health Association, the average social worker has 25 clients at once. Only 18% of their time is spent on direct client service and the rest of their time is spent tracking clients down, documenting, reporting, etc. Because of the high stress and administration burden, studies have revealed annual turnover of 41% to 51% among U.S. social workers.

                        As a community-based organization offering a variety of social and educational services to our clients, it is important to maintain high-touch communication with them.  TextUp allows staff to work together in our respective groups without risking leaking personal client information or having to give out staff members' personal numbers. The group messaging allows us to deliver information to our entire program or organization in seconds rather than spending days calling and following up with clients on the phone. With our limited staff time and resources, it has been a great tool to enhance our agency communication overall.

                        TextUp has really revolutionized the way we communicate— both with our clients and with each other. One of the features I love the most is that it provides a second line that we can use on our existing phones. If I had one more thing to hold on to, I would certainly lose it. Having a work number that I can have with me—that I can readily turn on and turn off based on my availability—is really, really helpful.

                        Recently we've started using the share feature a lot because oftentimes what we'll do is we'll start with a client working with one person, but then we'll connect them with another staff member. And being able to link that staff member into the existing conversation both gives them context and allows them to start forming a relationship with the client.

                        While completing internships in social work, Brown University Graduates Michelle Peterson and Eric Bai, along with their friend Hanna Oh, a graduate from the Rhode Island School of Design, all came to a startling realization: They were all overwhelmed by how overworked their colleagues and supervisors were.

                        A pair of social workers teamed up with a friend in design to develop a secure messaging and software platform that streamlines communication with colleagues and clients. TextUp enables social workers to keep personal phone numbers private and quickly access records from phone interactions, among other things.

                    </h4>
                    <p class="text">
                        Brown University student Michelle Petersen was named the top winner in the 2018 Rhode Island Business Plan Competiton.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Petersen, due to receive her bachelor's degree in public policy this month, said social workers typically handle up to 60 clients simultaneously, but on average dedicate only about 18% of their time to direct client service. The rest of their time is spent managing and documenting interactions. She said, TextUp, which tracks all critical information, allows users to devote more time on clients, fostering more enduring relationships and reducing job turnover.

                        Perhaps one of the loveliest trends in the startup world — besides driving change for the better, duh — is the increasingly crazy ways companies make their cultures incredible.

                        Regardless, we asked the Rhode Island startup and entrepreneurial community for input on which in-state companies were the coolest — and it answered the call. Together, with editorial insight, we developed a list of nominees.
